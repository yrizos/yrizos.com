I'm Yannis Rizos, Chief Software Architect at [Epignosis](https://www.epignosishq.com/) in Athens, Greece. I have spent nearly 20 years designing and building backend systems for learning platforms, reservation engines, marketplaces, and e-commerce products. Today I lead the Architecture Team at [TalentLMS](https://www.talentlms.com/), focusing on modernizing our platform and enabling other teams to move faster.

I discovered programming at 7 and soon after came across Larry Wall's three virtues: **laziness**, **impatience**, and **hubris**. The idea is to build systems that sustain themselves, prevent crises before they appear, and have the confidence to make hard decisions when comfort would be easier.

That last one is the hardest.

## How We Work

The Architecture Team at TalentLMS operates as an enabling team in the [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/) sense. We work with stream-aligned and platform teams such as QA, DevOps, and SecOps to reduce cognitive load and remove friction. Our goal is not ownership but acceleration.

Modernizing a platform that serves millions of users means evolving what exists. We look for places where automation removes friction, where boundaries restrict flow, and where structure no longer fits the pace of change. Progress happens through steady improvement that compounds over time.

Conway's Law appears in almost everything we do. Team structures and system structures reflect each other. Ignoring that relationship breaks both. We refine boundaries, responsibilities, and feedback loops as carefully as code. Shared language keeps meaning aligned. Bounded contexts protect clarity and prevent complexity from leaking across teams.

## Growing Capability

Alongside this work, my favorite sidequest is running the Tech Mentorship program. I pair less experienced developers with senior engineers to strengthen the capability of the organization itself. The goal is to develop the judgment that architectural work depends on. The better the judgment, the better the trade-offs.

Every technical decision carries tension between cost, complexity, speed, and maintainability. Architecture is deciding which tension to accept and which to release. The right choice shifts over time, so clarity matters more than rules. When compromises are visible, they stay flexible. When they are hidden, they harden into debt.

## Balancing Forces

Modernization makes those trade-offs visible. Automating saves time but shifts focus. Refactoring slows delivery to protect future speed. Simplifying an API can help one team while limiting another. These are not failures but part of how large systems stay alive.

Architecture succeeds only when teams and systems evolve together. The same feedback loops that keep collaboration healthy keep production stable. When teams keep scope clear, decisions local, and recovery simple, change stays safe. Resilience grows from sound judgment supported by strong structure, and that ability to reason through change keeps an organization capable of improvement.
