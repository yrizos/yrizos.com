It was the opening event of the Athens chapter of the Global Mindstone Practical AI community, and the energy in the room matched that sense of beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talk focused on the gap between getting an LLM to produce decent output and delivering something that can serve 25 million users. The distance between those two points is filled with the kind of engineering problems that don’t show up in demos. APIs fail at random, costs can spiral over a weekend, and teams need systems they can maintain without losing their minds.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Breaking Down the Monolith</title><link>https://yrizos.com/speaking/breaking-down-the-monolith/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2023 10:00:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://yrizos.com/speaking/breaking-down-the-monolith/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The Athens Megaron International Conference Center is an imposing place. Walking into it that morning felt like stepping into a different league. It was my first time presenting to a large audience, and we had no idea what to expect. Five minutes before the session started, the room was already packed. People were standing along the walls and at the back, trying to find a spot. It was equal parts exhilarating and nerve-racking.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
