I could see that much walking in. No clear maps. No reliable guides. Just a system that worked well enough that no one had bothered to document where the traps were hidden.</p><p>Taking over a new team means making choices about what comes first. Most leaders push for quick wins. Ship a feature. Show value. Build momentum. I did the opposite. I told the team we were stopping feature work for an entire sprint. We would fix bugs, pay down technical debt, and repair what was broken.</p><p>They looked at me like I was insane.</p><h2 id=why-repair-whynow>Why Repair, Why Now</h2><p>Bug bashes happen all the time. Teams schedule hardening sprints when stakeholders panic or when delivery breaks spectacularly. These are reactive patterns, crisis responses. What I was proposing was different. Strategic. Deliberate.</p><p>I needed to understand two systems simultaneously. The technical one which was opaque and poorly documented. The human one, which was stressed and uncertain after months without clear leadership. Feature work would teach me what the team already knew how to do. Repair work would show me what they avoided, what they feared, and where the real complexity lived.</p><p>Stakeholders noticed immediately. Feature delivery paused for an entire sprint. I didn’t hide it or apologize. I framed repair as onboarding. I was new. I needed to understand the system before making commitments about it. That framing held because I had the authority to make it hold. Someone without that leverage might not have gotten the breathing room.</p><p>The team’s reaction told me something important. Relief. Not frustration. Relief. They felt permission to care about code quality again, something they hadn’t felt in a long time.</p><h2 id=what-the-bugs-toldme>What the Bugs Told Me</h2><p>The first issue we tackled looked trivial. A third-party integration is failing intermittently. It should have been a day’s work.</p><p>It was unfixable.</p><p>Not because of code complexity. Not because of architectural problems. The team had no sandbox access to the vendor system. They’d been requesting it for months. Nothing had happened. So they’d adapted. Built workarounds. Tested in production. Normalized the broken state so completely that no one had bothered documenting the limitation.</p><p>I asked where this was written down. Nowhere. I asked why no one had escalated. Shrugs. “That’s just how it is.”</p><p>This became the pattern. Real constraints surfaced only under direct pressure. Documentation lied by omission. Design diagrams showed clean boundaries that didn’t exist. Feature work never exposed these gaps because features stayed inside known territory. Bugs dragged us into corners where assumptions broke, and the actual architecture revealed itself.</p><p>One bug cluster pointed at something else entirely. Not technical failures but unclear product decisions. Requirements that had been deferred so long they’d calcified into implicit assumptions. No one had written them down. They existed only as hundreds of small implementation choices scattered across the codebase.</p><p>The system under strain told the truth. Everything else told comfortable stories.</p><h2 id=what-the-people-toldme>What the People Told Me</h2><p>Debugging exposes competence differently than feature work does. I watched how different engineers approached problems. One moved methodically, testing each step before proceeding. Another made rapid changes, hoping something would land. The contrast showed who understood the system’s internals and who was still guessing their way through it.</p><p>Tool choices revealed even more. Some developers reached for logs, metrics, and staging environments. They built understanding from observable data. Others cleared caches and redeployed without investigating what had changed. The system was a black box; they treated it as if it responded to ritual.</p><p>One developer stood out immediately. She always checked git commits and deploy notes before touching anything. Version control as investigative record, not just backup storage. That habit cut her debugging time dramatically while everyone else thrashed.</p><p>A quieter developer surprised me during one session. Her problem-solving approach was careful, systematic, and thorough. Normal feature work would never have made this visible. She gained credibility that carried forward into every subsequent technical discussion.</p><p>Knowledge had pooled dangerously. Every complex question is funneled to the same person. One silo. One bottleneck. The team couldn’t scale like this.</p><p>When someone admitted she didn’t know where to start with a particular issue, I suggested pairing. We debugged together. Fixed the problem. More importantly, we captured what we’d learned. We wrote a test. We added comments. We left a trail.</p><p>This became standard practice. Every fix left something behind. Failing conditions became automated tests. Unclear behavior became documentation. The team started seeing tests and documentation differently. Not overhead. Not process for process’s sake. Immediate value. When yesterday’s test caught today’s regression, the feedback loop closed instantly.</p><h2 id=what-the-repair-cycle-established>What the Repair Cycle Established</h2><p>Taking over a team creates stress. Uncertainty about what will change runs high while everyone evaluates the new leader. Pushing straight into feature work would have spiked that pressure immediately, forcing technical decisions before trust existed.</p><p>Starting with the repair shifted everything. We tackled visible frustrations first. Reduced debt that had been grinding against daily work. Built small wins that people could feel in their own workflows. Confidence grew through shared action, not promises.</p><p>The team’s language changed. “How fast can we fix this?” became “Will this hold?” Quality stopped being something that happened to them and became something they shaped actively.</p><p>Repair wasn’t penance. It wasn’t an admission that previous work had been bad. It was an investment. We were building a foundation for everything that would come after.</p><p>By the end of that sprint, I had context that no documentation could have provided. I understood where confidence lived and where it didn’t. I saw what people avoided. Where they hesitated. What they trusted.</p><p>The real constraints that shaped daily work were mapped. Dependencies that blocked progress. Modules no one dared touch. Missing test coverage. Knowledge silos. None of this appeared in system diagrams. All of it determined how work actually happened.</p><h2 id=the-mapped-territory>The Mapped Territory</h2><p>Every team carries history. Failed projects. Legacy systems. Technical decisions made under constraints that no longer exist. Starting with the repair didn’t fix everything at once. It created a foundation for sustainable progress.</p><p>The bugs mattered. But what surfaced during debugging mattered more. The hidden architecture of both the technical system and the human system became visible. The dangerous passages in the temple were marked now. The loose stones were identified. The team knew which paths could bear weight.</p><p>Repair isn’t the opposite of progress. It’s what makes progress sustainable. Feature work can wait one sprint. Understanding cannot.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><hr><div class=post-original-notice>Originally published at <a href=https://medium.com/@yrizos/into-the-codebase-one-bug-at-a-time-1bc991ce9a07 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>medium.com/@yrizos</span></a></div><div class=post-license><a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="fa-brands fa-creative-commons"></i>
