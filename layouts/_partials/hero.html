<h2>Hello there! How can I help?</h2>
<p>I'm Yannis Rizos, a software architect from Athens, Greece, with nearly 20 years of experience in tech. My work revolves around crafting systems that are not only secure and scalable but also deeply aligned with business needs. Right now, I'm bringing these principles to life as part of the amazing team at <a href="https://www.epignosishq.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Epignosis</a>, where we're shaping the future of <a href="https://www.talentlms.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TalentLMS</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout my career, I've tackled projects across learning platforms, reservation tools, and online marketplaces. Each challenge has sharpened my focus on building resilient teams, solving tough problems, and staying curious about how technology can push boundaries.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I'm a dad, an avid reader, and, when time permits, a gamer.</p>
