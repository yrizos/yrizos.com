<h1>Hello! 👋</h1>
<p>I'm Yannis, a software engineer in Athens, Greece. I design systems that survive contact with reality and help teams move faster without breaking things.</p>
<p>I occasioanly write about software architecture, the trade-offs that come with building systems meant to last, and the organizational forces that shape them.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I'm a dad, an avid reader, and, when time permits, a gamer.</p>
