I figured if I was asking people to bet time on something uncertain, I should at least be honest about the odds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking over a new team means making choices about what comes first. Most leaders push for quick wins. Ship a feature. Show value. Build momentum. I did the opposite. I told the team we were stopping feature work for an entire sprint. We would fix bugs, pay down technical debt, and repair what was broken.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
