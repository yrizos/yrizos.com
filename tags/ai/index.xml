It was the opening event of the Athens chapter of the Global Mindstone Practical AI community, and the energy in the room matched that sense of beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talk focused on the gap between getting an LLM to produce decent output and delivering something that can serve 25 million users.

APIs fail at random, costs can spiral over a weekend, and teams need systems they can maintain without losing their minds.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The End of Coding as We Know It</title><link>https://yrizos.com/writing/the-end-of-coding-as-we-know-it/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 22:48:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yrizos.com/writing/the-end-of-coding-as-we-know-it/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In 1839, Louis Daguerre’s invention, the daguerreotype, was unveiled to the world as a gift from France to humanity.

People genuinely wondered if painting would become obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
