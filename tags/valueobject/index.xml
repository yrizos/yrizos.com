The company had an ERP system and an e-commerce platform, and needed them to communicate with each other. My job was to build the integration layer that would keep product data flowing between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirements seemed straightforward enough. The ERP would send product information, my system would translate it, and the store would receive it. Both systems used product codes to identify items, and since those codes looked like ordinary strings, I treated them as ordinary strings. That&amp;rsquo;s what the rest of the codebase did, and it felt like the natural choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
